## 출판 논문
### Global Weight: Network-level weight sharing for deep neural network compression
  - Eunseop Shin, Sung-Ho Bae(Kyunghee Univ.)
  -  Korean Institute of Broadcast and Media Engineers, 2020 Summer Conference, Oral.
  - In order to compress a large-sized deep neural network, we propose a global weight method, a network-level weight sharing method. The existing weight sharing method used to reuse and share weights for each layer and block. Unlike the existing method, Global Weight is an efficient method of sharing weights across the entire network.

### A New Neural Architecture Search Using Self-Attention Operation
  - Eunseop Shin, Sung-Ho Bae(Kyunghee Univ.)
  - Korea Software Congress KSC2019, Undergraduate student poster.
  - Existing DARTS only had very simple operations as candidates. The self-attention operation showed good performance in the model found by humans. Therefore, we constructed a new search space by adding the Self-Attention calculation to the DARTS search space.

### Monocular Image Depth Estimation using Synthetic Soccer Data based on Deep Neural Networks
  - Eunseop Shin, Youmin Kim, Sung-Ho Bae(Kyunghee Univ.)
  - Korea Software Congress KSC2018, Undergraduate student poster.
  - Unlike the existing depth prediction, it is difficult to acquire data with a sense of depth in soccer images. To solve this problem, data was acquired from the FIFA game where it is easy to acquire data with a sense of depth, and the depth of the actual soccer image was more accurately predicted by performing style conversion between the real image and the virtual image.
